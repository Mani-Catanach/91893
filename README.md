This is a pizza cost calculator. It tallies the cost of your employees wages, 
and the cost of your utilities, on a weekly basis. 
After entering the price you sell your pizzas for and how much each pizza costs to make, the
program works out the profit, and tells you the maximum, minimu, and average amount of pizzas
you need to sell and break even.

The final program file is B_01_PCC_v4. v1-v3 have numerous bugs and issues so should not be considered 
usable but are there to showcase the development process.
The major components that make up the program are C_01-10. C_11 and C_12 are unused in v4 but were part of
previous iterations such as in v1-v3.

Unused variations like the string checker are part of the trialling of unique variants
